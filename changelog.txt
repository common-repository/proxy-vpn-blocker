* Fixed an issue where the Cloudflare option was the reverse on servers that don't support X-Forwarded-For headers used by Cloudflare - If you had the Plugin Cloudflare switch set to "on" on such servers it was doing the opposite and not supporting Cloudflare and "off" was the Cloudflare supporting state.
